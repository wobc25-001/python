# Exercise 1: Variables, Strings, Lists
# Write a program that:
# 
# o Takes the first two command line arguments (excluding the
# filename). Both of them will be strings, and both of them will be
# long enough that you will not get index errors.
# Print those two arguments, separated by a space.
# Prints a string consisting of the first character of the first argument,
# 
# followed by the third character of the second argument, followed by
# the last character of the second argument, followed by the length of
# the first argument.
# Prints two empty lines.
# Prints the total number of arguments (including file name).
# Print the 2nd - 4th characters of the first argument.
# Prints the phrase "use of 'quotationâ€™ marks".
# 
# o Takes input from the user with the prompt "please enter: " and
# 
# prints the second character of the user input.

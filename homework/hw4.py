# Create program that:
# 
# Reads a filename from the command line.
# 
# Determines the most common letter in the file that is not the white space
# 
# characters, and prints what it is and how many times it occurs. Use the format

# Writes the first ten words of the file (as determined by whitespace) to a new file
# 
# named "ten_words.txt". Assume the file will be written to the same directory

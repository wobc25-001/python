# Exercise 19: Classes
# Create a program that has a class named Sphere that:
# » Takes a numeric value (float or int) representing the radius when it is
# declared.
# 
# o Sphere should have at least three methods
# 
# o get_surface_area, which returns the surface area of the
# sphere
# o get_volume, which returns the volume of the sphere
# 
# o set_radius, which changes the radius of the sphere. It
# should result in new values being returned from the other
# two methods.
# 
# Feel free to set __init__ or other methods as necessary to
# accomplish the task.
# To ensure you match the test cases exactly, use 3.14 as your
# approximation for 1. The surface area of a sphere is 4*m*r*2; the
# volume of a sphere is 4/3*m*r’3.
# e The program will accept multiple command line arguments.
# 
# When the program runs, it calculates the surface area and volume for
# the provided numeric value (radius). Then the program adds 1 to the
# numeric value (radius), sets the new radius, and computes the
# 
# surface area and volume for the new radius value.
# The program prints out the radius, surface area, and volume for the
# initial radius and the new radius.

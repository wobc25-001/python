# Exercise 17: First Letter
# Create a program that has a function named first that:
# Takes a string as an argument.
# Returns the first character that is not repeated anywhere in the string.
# If a string contains all repeating characters, it should return an empty string "".
# Upper and lowercase letters are considered the same character, but the
# function should return the correct case for the initial letter. For example, the
# input "sTreSS" should return "T".

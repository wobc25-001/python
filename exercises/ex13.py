# Exercise 13: File & Dictionary Manipulation
# reate a program that:
# 
# Reads a filename from the command line.
# Determines the most common letter in the file that is not the white space
# 
# characters, and prints what it is and how many times it occurs. Use the format
# " is the most common letter. It occurs _times." Replace _ with the appropriate
# letter (uppercase) and number.
# 
# Determines what percentage of the number of words in the file is the word
# "the"; print the integer that is closest to this percentage, rounding down.
# Ignore capitalization: "The" and "the" are the same word.
# 
# Writes the first ten words of the file (as determined by whitespace) to a new file
# 
# named "Exercise_8_output.txt". Assume the file will be written to the same
# directory where exercise8.py is located.

# Exercise 20: Positive Properties
# 
# Create a program that has a class named Number, which is initialized
# with a positive integer n as its sole argument. It should have at least four
# methods:
# 
# - is_prime returns True if nis prime, and False if not. 1 is not prime.
# 
# - get_divisors returns a list of positive divisors of n, in ascending
# order.
# - get_gcd takes a positive integer argument, and
# 
# returns the greatest common divisor of n and the argument.
# - get_lcm takes a positive integer argument, and returns the least
# common (positive) multiple of n and the argument.

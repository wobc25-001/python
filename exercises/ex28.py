# Exercise 28
# The purpose of this program is to retrieve the host system informationand the results
# in a formatted way.
# The program will:
# 
# e
# 
# only execute commands if execution occurred as a result of thisprogram name
# being called and not when imported
# 
# e
# 
# when imported, functions will only execute when called
# 
# e
# 
# create a func
# 
# ‘unctions toperform the
# 
# required acti
# create a function called retrieve_host_information
# 
# is not passed anything
# 
# returns the result of the os.uname method
# 
# create a function called print_host_information
# 
# is passed the result of the os.uname method
# prints the information os.uname results (one per line) with the
# fieldname (attribute) and its value separated by a " => "
# 
# o the fields (attributes) to recover from os.uname are:
# m
# 
# sysname
# 
# =
# 
# nodename
# 
# =
# 
# release
# 
# ®
# 
# version
# 
# =
# 
# machine
# 
# o the values associated with each field can be retrieved using thegetattr
# 
# function
# o
# 
# does not return anything
# 
# Exercise Notes:
# e
# 
# The program should have the __main__test with a main() function that
# 
# executes the code
# e
# 
# There is no requirement to retrieve anything from the command line
# 
# e
# 
# Functions must be named exactly as listed above
# 
# e
# 
# Output must be identically formatted as to what is shown here
# 
# Grading:
# 
# Grading will be based upon whether the requirements are met and if the
# 
# code executes without errors or warnings to complete the requirements. Partial
# credit may be granted, if code is there to support it when a requirement has not been
# met. The submitted program must work with python3.8 and on the classroom
# machine.

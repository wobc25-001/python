# Homework 1
# Concepts covered:
# - User input
# - String concatenation
# 
# - String formatting
# - Variable assignment
# - Comments
# 
# - Mathematical Operators
# 
# - Floats
# 
# Create a program that accepts the age, first name, and last name of the user as user
# input.
# 
# The program should then print:
# 
# 1. A sentence that states the user's birthyear.
# 2. 3 possible username formats based on their first name and last name.
# 3. 2 possible years the user might have graduated high school.
# 4. 3 possible "@gmail.com" email addresses based on the previous identified
# username formats.
# 5. Percentage of life completed based on life expectancy of 73.4.
# General requirements for the program:
# 1. Shebang so it can be run by executing the file
# 2. Use both string concantenation and string formatting at least once.
# 3. Use appropriate variables to assign your values.
# 4. Use appropriate comments to explain how your program is functioning.
# 5. Name your file "Iname_hw1.py"

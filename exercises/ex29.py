# Exercise 29
# The purpose of this program is to retrieve the host system platform information
# and the results in a formatted way.
# The program will:
# 
# 
# only execute commands if execution occurred as a result of this program name
# being called and not when imported
# 
# 
# when imported, functions will only execute when called
# 
# 
# create a function called main that will call the other functions to perform the
# 
# 
# create a function called retrieve_platform_information
# 
# required actions
# 
# 
# o
# 
# is not passed anything
# 
# o
# 
# returns the result of the platform.uname method
# 
# create a function called print_platform_information
# o
# o
# 
# s passed the result of the platform.uname method
# prints the information platform.uname results (one per line) with the
# field name (attribute) and its value separated by a " =>"
# 
# o the fields (attributes) to recover from platform.uname are:
# 
# o
# 
# =
# 
# system
# 
# =
# 
# node
# 
# =
# 
# release
# 
# =
# 
# version
# 
# =
# 
# machine
# 
# =
# 
# processor
# 
# when the field name (attributes) is printed, it should be printed as title
# case
# 
# o the values associated with each field can be retrieved using the getattr
# 
# function
# o
# 
# does not return anything
# 
# Exercise Notes:
# 
# 
# The program should have the __main__test with a main() function that
# 
# 
# Thereisnot
# 
# 
# Functionsm
# 
# executes the code
# â€˜he command line
# 
# Output must be identically formatted as to what is shown here
# 
# Grading: Grading will be based upon whether the requirements are met and if the
# code executes without errors or warnings to complete the requirements. Partial
# credit may be granted, if code is there to support it when a requirement has not been
# met. The submitted program must work with python3.8 and on the classroom
# machine.

# 99 BOTTLES:
# Design a program that mimics the "99 bottles of beer" nursery rhyme. The program will
# iterate through the rhyme printing the verses and iterating from 99 to zero.
# 
# add the --w option that forces the program to print out the numbers as words.
# EX: 99 --> ninety-nine
# 
# 
# >>> python3 bottles.py --w
# 
# add the --n option to allow the user to select a different number between 99 and 1.
# >>> python3 bottles.py --n 50
# 
# Â¢
# 
# add the --b option that allows the user to choose a different beverage than beer. EX:
# coke

# Exercise 26
# The purpose of this program is to retrieve, format, and print the shell environmental
# variables for the user running the program. The program will:
# only execute commands if execution occurred as a result of this program name
# 
# when imported, functions will only execute when called
# 
# create a function called main that will call the other functions to perform the
# 
# create a function called retrieve_env_variables
# 
# being called and not when imported
# 
# required actions
# 
# retrieve the environmental variables with associated values
# 
# return the variable name with associated value
# 
# create a function called format_env_variables
# environmental variable name left justified within a 30 character string
# 
# value formatting does not change
# 
# create a function called print_env_variables
# prints the formatted environmental variable
# followed directly by a colon and a space
# 
# followed directly by the value that the environmental variable holds
# 
# formats the key/value pairs
# 
# end the line with one new line
# 
# Output (partial - data will change for the user):
# exercise3_format_environment.py
# 
# Exercise Notes:
# e
# 
# The program should have the
# 
# main
# 
# test with a main() function that
# 
# executes the
# °
# °
# 
# There is no requirement to retrieve anything from the command line
# Functions must be named exactly as listed above
# Output must be identically formatted as to what is shown here
# 
# Grading:
# 
# Grading will be based upon whether the requirements are met and if the
# 
# code executes without errors or warnings to complete the requirements. Partial
# credit may be granted, if code is there to support it when a requirement has not been
# met.
# 
# The submitted program must work with python3.8 and on the classroom machine.

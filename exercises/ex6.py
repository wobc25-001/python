# Exercise 6: Loops
# Create a program that takes one integer command line argument.
# 
# Ensure the argument is an integer, if not the program doesn't do
# anything.
# 
# For each number between 1 and the argument (inclusive), print the
# word "triangle" if the number is a multiple of three.
# Print "square" if it is a multiple of four.
# If it is @ multiple of 12, do not print triangle or square. Instead, print
# "x dozen" where x is the numeral representing how many dozen
# 
# you're at("1 dozen" for 12, "2 dozen" for 24, etc.)
# Lastly, print the sum of the numbers between 1 and the argument
# (inclusive).

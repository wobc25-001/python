# Exercise 23: Blackjack, Guessing Game, Etc.
# Blackjack:
# Design an object-oriented program for a simple blackjack game that provides for one
# player and a dealer (the computer).
# The dealer must continue to take cards until the dealer's hand has at least
# 17 points.
# 
# Don't allow the player to split the hand.
# 
# Aces can be one or eleven depending on logic in the code.
# If the user keeps asking for a card (hit) and the total score goes over 21, the
# user busts.
# If the dealer goes over 21, the dealer busts.
# 
# If the dealer and user have the same score, 21 or under, they tie.
# The highest hand without going over 21 wins.
# 
# It is up to the programmer to develop a player class, or not.
# 
# Below is a suggested Card and Deck class.

# self.suit

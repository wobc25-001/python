# Exercise 25
# The purpose of this program is to create a program that is the beginning of a
# custom library to test file attributes that will be imported by another program in
# order for the function(s) within it can be called. In this function:
# create a function called is_file_readable
# 
# uses 0s.access
# 
# return True if the passed file is readable
# 
# return False if the passed file is not readable
# 
# create a function called is_file_executable
# 
# uses 0s.access
# 
# return True if the passed file is readable
# 
# return False if the passed file is not readable
# 
# will not perform any calculations or print statements when this program is
# 
# executed by its name
# Exercise Notes:
# 
# The program does not need a __main__ because it is meant to be imported
# 
# Functions must be named exactly as listed above
# 
# Grading: Grading will be based upon whether the requirements are met and if the
# code executes without errors or warnings to complete the requirements. Partial
# credit may be granted, if code is there to support it when a requirement has not been
# met. The submitted program must work with python3.8 and on the classroom
# machine.

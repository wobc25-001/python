This program contains functions used to perform various file tests
It is intended only to be used as an include to another program

Create a program that will be included as a module within other program.
This program should be set up where it can be included and when called
returns the result of a file test. The program, when executed by its
name, will perform no calculations or prints. It merely serves as the
start of a personal file test library. The file tests to perform are:
- Is the file readable: returns True if it is; False if it is not
- Is the file executable: returns True if it is; False if it is not

Exercise Notes:
- The program does not need a __main__ because it is meant to be imported

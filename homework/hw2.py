# Create a function to take a password as user input. Using a while loop, if the
# password is less than 14 characters, prompt the user for a password until the user
# input is 14 or more characters. Once the user types in a password of 14 or more
# characters, check the password for an uppercase, lowercase, digit, and special
# character. If the user has all elements, print out that the password is secure, else
# print out password is not secure.
# 
# Please see the below image as a sample of what your program could look like. You do
# not have to specify how many or which character sets are missing. | just wanted to
# track it during my testing.

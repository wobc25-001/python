# Exercise 11: Fibonacci Functions
# Create a program that has two functions, which_fibonacci and next_fibonacci.
# Â¢
# 
# which_fibonacci takes a non-negative integer as an argument, which may or
# 
# may not be a Fibonacci number. Ifitis, then it returns its position in the
# sequence. For example, 2 is the 4th Fibonacci number. If 1 is given as the
# argument, the function should return 2. If the argument is not a Fibonacci
# number, the function returns 0.
# 
# next_fibonacci takes a non-negative integer and returns the next largest
# Fibonacci number. If the argument is itself a Fibonacci number, it should
# return the next Fibonacci number, not the argument itself. If1 is received,
# next_fibonacci should return 2. If the argument is not a fibonacci number, it
# should return the next fibonacci number after the argument.

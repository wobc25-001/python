# Create a program that takes (at least) three command line
# arguments. The first two will be integers and the third will be a string.
#

# 
# If the word "time" appears in the string, print the sum of the
# integers.
#

# the string.
# If there are more than three command line arguments (excluding
# the filename), print the word "errorTM.

# Exercise 2: Attention to Detail
# Create a program that takes (at least) three command line arguments. The first two
# will be integers and the third will be a float.
# 
# On one line, separated by spaces, print the sum of the first two arguments, the
# product of the first and third arguments, the first argument modulo the second,
# and the integer quotient of the first by the third.
# Add 1 to all three arguments.
# On a new line, print the first argument bitwise left shift 3, the second
# argument divided by 2 (not integer division), and the bitwise OR (operator) of
# the first and second arguments. (all separated by spaces.)
# On the last line, print the sum of the first argument (after the addition) and the
# total number of arguments, excluding the program name.
# Make sure the output numbers that are floats are at two digits of precision.
